        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>In this sample, first two columns are fixed on left side of the Grid, while other columns remain non-fixed. When scrolling the grid view, the fixed columns will remain at the same position.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>You can fix columns either on left or right side of the Grid. The view will display columns following this priority (from top to low): left, right, none. This means that columns fixed on left side will appear in front of all other columns.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>When column is fixed it will appear in darker colors then non-fixed columns. This is set via CSS and you can modify it on your side.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>You can change the fixed state of a column either initially, or during run-time. Whenever this change happens, the grid layout requires an update. You can update the grid by calling the updateLayout method.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>When you have fixed and non-fixed columns, because cells can have different content, the row with cells from fixed and non-fixed columns, can appear unaligned. To make sure the cells are aligned at all times, use the <span class="code-name">rowHeight</span> property and set it to desired number.</p>
