        <p><span class="initial-space"></span><strong><span class="code-name">IntegralUI</span> SplitContainer</strong> is a native Web Component that consists of two resizable panels separated by a splitter with tabs and command buttons. It allows you to place different content in two panels and change their size during run-time.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>The demonstration above shows a SplitContainer component, with option to change its orientation to horizontal or vertical. Each panel is represented by a tab with icon and title, also there is a swap button that when clicked will swap panels on demand. By left click and hold the splitter handle, you can change the size of panels.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>You may also notice that the top/left panel has condition set to prevent its height/width go below 100px. This is done by handling the <span class="code-name">splitterMoving</span> event in your code and set the condition there.</p>
