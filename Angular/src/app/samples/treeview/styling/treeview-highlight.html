        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>In this example, you can highlight items using a checkbox. Whenever item is checked, a vertical green line will appear in front of the item and the label appears in bold.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>For demonstration purposes, root items don't have a check box and you can't highlight them. You can choose other ways to highlight items, like changing their background color or applying a different style on demand.</p>
