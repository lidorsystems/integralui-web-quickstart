    <div class="feature-help">
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>In above demo, expand boxes are represented by open/close folder icon, and additionally locked items display the locked folder icon.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>Default CSS classes responsible for expand box appearance are modified and instead of default arrow icons, a set of custom icons are used. Furthermore, one item is marked as locked, that is it cannot become expanded, by handling the <span class="code-object"beforeExpand></span> event and canceling the expand process. Additionaly, the expand box is changed to a locked folder icon, to make visual reprsentation of the locked state.</p>
