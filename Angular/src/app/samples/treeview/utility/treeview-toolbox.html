    <div class="feature-help">
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>In above demonstration, we have a TreeView that appears like an Accordion. Root items behave like group headers and their content is a list of child items. Whenever a child items is selected, its parent item is also highlighted.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>This is accomplished by setting tree item indent to 0 and handling selection events, modifying corresponding CSS classes and applying inline styles.</p>
