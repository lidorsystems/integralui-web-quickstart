        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>This sample shows how to filter the TreeView content using different conditions.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>By selecting an operation from dropdown filter and specifying matching value, you can filter the TreeView so that only those items that matches the specified condition are shown.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>By default, filtering is executed using the item's value field to match the specified criteria. If this field value is empty, then the value of item's text field is used. If parent item has children that passes the filter conditions, then parent item also passes the filter conditions. This is determined from <span class="code-object">allowParent</span> field in filter parameters.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>For filtering operations we are using the <strong>IntegralUIFilterService</strong>, which provides many ways to set string, numeric or custom filtering using multiple conditions with multiple AND / OR combinations.</p>
        <p><span class="initial-space"></span>You can also create a custom filtering operation, but you would need to create a function in your code and apply it to the callback field of filtering parameter.</p>
